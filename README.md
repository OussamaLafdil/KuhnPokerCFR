In this report, we present an application of the Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm for solving imperfect information games.
After explaining the algorithm's principles, analyzing the results, we can conclude that this algorithm is an effective approach for finding optimal strategies in imperfect information games. Indeed, the algorithm's ability to converge to a Nash equilibrium ensures that the found strategy is optimal and cannot be improved by any other strategy.
It is a powerful tool for solving games like Kuhn Poker, thanks to its capability to learn from previous experiences and adjust its strategy to maximize gains.
